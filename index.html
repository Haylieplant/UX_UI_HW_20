      <h1>San Antonio Zoo RWD Case Study</h1>
      <p>THE PROBLEM: 
        Due to the fact that the San Antonio Zoo is a Non-profit the majority of their revenue comes from ticket sales.  They are having to make adjustments during this pandemic, we want to help redesign website to help bring people to the Zoo and generate more income for the Zoo.  The current website is little confusing and hard to find infomation about the activites that they are offerning during COVID.  Also, the COVID infomation is buried deep in the website and herd to find 
        THE SOLUTION: 
        Our plan is to condense the infomaiton on the website, make the most important infomation front and center, and add icons to help the user naviagate the webiste eaiser.

        <p>Our plan for the redesign of the San Antonio Zoo website is to help the zoo reach a wider customer base during this pandemic. 
            We want to make it easier for the user to find information on the Zoo, the covid-19 action plans, and their current activities the Zoo is offering. 
            We feel by making these changes that it can help the user know what is going on at the zoo and increase the zoo’s revenue during covid-19.

        <p>During our research, we conducted 6-1 on 1 interviews and created a survey for social media, to gain insight on the people that go to the Zoo.  We discovered a need to help increase the traffic to the San Antonio Zoo a nonprofit organization. Our research showed that while families were aware that the zoo is open but that they were unaware of the events being offered during the Covid pandemic. We believe that by raising awareness of the events being offered the San Antonio zoo will be a rise in attendance and income.

              <p>Once we had gathered most of the data from our interviews and surveys we wanted to take what we learned from the user and mkae sure we incorporated all the important details into the new website for the Zoo.</p>

              <p>
                Through our interviews and research we complied our data and created an Affinity diagram to tell us who our user is. Here are a few things that we learned: 
                
                For people that want to go to the Zoo, they really don’t plan their trip, they just go.  
                But, they usually will check Facebook to get their info and see what is going on,
                or they recieve an email of the current events.
                The majority of people that we interviewed doesn’t use the website. 
                If they do, they will access if through their phone
                Members go to the Zoo about once a week - Non members about 2-3 times a year
                
                With that data, we created a User Persona

              <p>Jennifer’s a full time job keeps her out of the loop with all the activites that the Zoo offers, but she loves doing things with her kids, espcecially taking her kids to the Zoo.
                During Covid she isn’t really sure what the precautions are
                She needs to stay within her weekly budget so she needs to plan the activities and cost in advance

        <p>With our research we conducted we found out a few intersting details about how peoplSthat is why we made the icons on the mobile version, to give the user quick access with out figuring where to find the information on the site.  We tried to condense the navigation tabs, we learned that it made it too confusing with just 5 tabs so we added a 6th tabs to keep they information more organized.

        <p>With several user testing sessions, we changed the footer, adding social isons to the mobile header, and focued on finding better icons for the desktop version. Our plan is to keep the Zoo website fun and cheerful, but not overwhelming and confusing for the user.  </p>
